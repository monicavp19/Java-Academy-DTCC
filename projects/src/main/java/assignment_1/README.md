# Assignment 1 - Getting Started 

### Integrated Development Environments (IDE)

An **IDE** is a tool where you can write, test, and package your software.

For this course we suggest you use **IntelliJ Community Edition**!

Please download and install **IntelliJ** from [this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

**Pro Tip** IntelliJ, can also install the JDK version of your choice for you. We
suggest that you at least once try to download and install the JDK yourself for practice.


### Java Development Kit (JDK)

Let's make sure we install the JDK, this will enable us to write Java code!

Please download and install OpenJDK from [this link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).

### Git

**Git** is an extremely popular software version control tool that enable teams
of software developers to work on software functionality cooperatively. 

Please download and install **Git** from [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

**GitHub** is an online repository where you can host the **source code** of your software
project. 

**Pro Tip**: there is a distinction between <u>source code</u> and what
folks may think of traditionally as a <u>"program.exe", the software executable</u>. 

We'll get more into how to package Java applications into a ".exe" later!

### Slack

We're going to use **Slack** to communicate informally within this course, please download it from [here](https://slack.com/downloads/)

Please remember that all official announcements will be issued through [D2L](https://mycourses.dtcc.edu/d2l/home)

After downloading Slack, within our session I will provide
an invite link.

This link will allow you to join the `Java-Academy-DTCC` workspace.
This is where we'll collaborate all be able to chat!

## Exercise 1

Please ensure that you've downloaded and installed:

- Slack
- Git
- Java (JDK, JRE)
- Intellij (IDE)

All of this software is cross-platform, but if you would like to use another
IDE, please feel free to use whatever you are comfortable with. 

## Exercise 2

- Please use Git to **fork** this repository
- Please use Git to **clone** your **forked repository** onto your machine that you plan to work with
- With IntelliJ, please import this project as a **maven** project

We have a sample Java class: `HelloWorld.java`

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    final private static String statement = "";
    public static void main (String[] args)  {
        System.out.println(statement);
    }
}
```

The goal of this assignment is for you to:
 
- Assign the `variable` <u>statement</u> the value "Hello World" (if you are unsure please reference the screenshot below).
- Press the play button to run this code and successfully see "Hello World" printed!

If you are able to complete this assignment you have
made your first steps into learning Java!


### Exercise 2 - Troubleshooting

- IntelliJ won't let me run this assignment
- Java hasn't installed
- I'm completely lost, please help!

**No worries** jump on **Slack** and I'll get you squared away!

### Exercise 2 - Activity Questions

- What is a `variable`?
- What is a `string`?
- What does `public static void main` mean?
